DRC : 

Design Rule Checks (DRC) are a series of checks performed on the physical layout of an integrated circuit (IC) to ensure that it adheres to the specified design rules and constraints. These checks are essential for verifying that the IC can be manufactured correctly and reliably. Here are common types of DRC checks:

1. **Spacing Rules**: Ensure that there is sufficient spacing between various layout features to prevent shorts and manufacturing issues. This includes checking minimum spacing between metal lines, vias, transistors, and other components.

2. **Width Rules**: Verify that the width of conductive paths and features, such as wires and transistors, meets the minimum and maximum width requirements specified in the design rules.

3. **Enclosure Rules**: Ensure that certain components are adequately enclosed within specific layers or boundaries, preventing electrical shorts and ensuring proper isolation.

4. **Overlap Rules**: Check for unwanted overlaps between different layers, features, or components. Overlaps can lead to shorts and other manufacturing problems.

5. **Notch Rules**: Verify that specified notches or cutouts are present in particular regions of the layout to prevent interference and shorts.

6. **Density Rules**: Ensure that the layout adheres to specified density constraints, preventing over-densification in specific regions and ensuring uniform manufacturing quality.

7. **Orthogonal Rules**: Confirm that specific features, such as wires and connections, follow a defined orthogonal (90-degree) orientation, which can aid in manufacturability.

8. **Alignment Rules**: Check that certain layout features are aligned with respect to a particular reference, which is important for ensuring correct connectivity and proper operation.

9. **Stitching Rules**: Verify that stitching or jumper structures are correctly placed to provide continuity in metal layers or other critical areas of the layout.

10. **Corner Rules**: Confirm that corners of layout features are correctly shaped and meet specific design rules, avoiding sharp corners that can lead to manufacturing defects.

11. **Electrical Connectivity Rules**: Check for proper electrical connectivity and the absence of unwanted open or disconnected paths.

12. **Symmetry Rules**: Ensure that symmetric components are correctly mirrored or rotated, adhering to design symmetry requirements.

13. **Abutment Rules**: Check for abutment, or the proper alignment of specific components along their edges to ensure correct interconnections.

14. **Edge Rules**: Examine the edges of the layout to ensure they meet specific requirements, including edge exclusion zones and edge termination structures.

15. **Legal Rules**: Verify that the layout adheres to legal constraints and intellectual property (IP) licensing agreements.

DRC checks are typically performed using specialized Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools. Once DRC checks are executed, a report is generated, highlighting any violations and providing details on their nature and location in the layout. Designers must address these violations through layout modifications and adjustments to ensure that the final IC can be manufactured correctly and reliably. The DRC process is iterative, with multiple checks and revisions, until the design is free from violations.
