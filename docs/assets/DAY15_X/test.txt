STEPS TO BUILD OPENLANE
git clone https://github.com/nickson-jose/openlane_build_script

sudo -i #switch to root user (or have root user password ready).

Change directory to where openlane_build_script folder was cloned. cd /path/to/openlane_build_script

Execute the script as below:

For standalone build

chmod 775 openlane_script.sh
./openlane_script.sh
For build in conjunction with vsdflow

Copy the openlane_script_wo_depends.sh to vsdflow folder.
chmod 775  openlane_script_wo_depends.sh
./openlane_script_wo_depends.sh
This script would create following directory structure:

For build in conjunction with vsdflow

STEPS TO RUN OPENLANE
Go to /path/to/openlane (i.e., ~/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/Openlane)

There are two ways of invoking openlane. The easiest of the two would be:

make mount
The second way would be to explicitly specify the path to PDK_ROOT and OPENLANE_IMAGE_NAME and invoking docker with these inputs

export PDK_ROOT=<absolute path to where skywater-pdk and open_pdks reside>
export OPENLANE_IMAGE_NAME=<docker image name>
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/openlane -v $PDK_ROOT:$PDK_ROOT -e PDK_ROOT=$PDK_ROOT -u $(id -u $USER):$(id -g $USER) $OPENLANE_IMAGE_NAME
Note: If you face "permission denied" during docker invocation in setup or in above step, do refer below link to resolve:

Fix Docker Permission Denied Issue
./flow.tcl -design spm (the above flow.tcl command will run RTL2GDS flow for design named "spm". Same can be done for other designs which are present in ~/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/Openlane/designs)

Refer to: https://github.com/efabless/openlane for detailed instructions.
